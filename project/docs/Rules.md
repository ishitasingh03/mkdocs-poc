A Rule is a set of expressions, with operators such as AND, OR between the given expressions . eg. 'City Equals to Jaipur OR City Equals to Panaji' entails a Rule. In the portal, a Rule is created by a set of expression ID's ( visible in a list), in conjunction with operators between the expression ID's. There are two ways to create a Rule. The first way, is by using the drag and drop feature, or by simply typing the rule to be created.

### Drag and drop : 
Drag the expression you want to include in your rule from the list, and drop it into the blank box. The operators are available to the right, and are draggable in the same fashion Please ensure that while creating a rule, the braces are balanced, the expression ID's are valid. Click on save rule to create

### Type Instead :
Type the operator separated list of expressions in the typebox. Have a look at Rule Description in table to understand how to type the expressions. Please do not type spaces in between while creating a rule. Doing so may result in the rule not being created.

### Note :
 Update Rule follows a similar format, except that in Update we need to specify the Rule ID that is to be updated. The ID can be obtained from the Rule Table . To Update the given Rule, choose the Update option from the Create, Update Dropdown option.
